Problem Statement
    	You are watching a soccer match, and you wonder what the probability is that at least one of the two teams will score a prime number of goals. The game lasts 90 minutes, and to simplify the analysis, we will split the match into five-minute intervals. The first interval is the first five minutes, the second interval is the next five minutes, and so on. During each interval, there is a skillOfTeamA percent probability that team A will score a goal, and a skillOfTeamB percent probability that teamB will score a goal. Assume that each team will score at most one goal within each interval. Return the probability that at least one team will have a prime number as its final score.
 
Definition
    	
Class:	PrimeSoccer
Method:	getProbability
Parameters:	int, int
Returns:	double
Method signature:	double getProbability(int skillOfTeamA, int skillOfTeamB)
(be sure your method is public)
    
 
Notes
-	The returned value must be accurate to within a relative or absolute value of 1E-9.
-	A prime number is a number that has exactly two divisors, 1 and itself. Note that 0 and 1 are not prime.
 
Constraints
-	skillOfTeamA will be between 0 and 100, inclusive.
-	skillOfTeamB will be between 0 and 100, inclusive.
